For motion up to theta = 0 degree:

	required: driver_theta0.m, set_figure.m, Invkin.m, draw*.m files

	1. Open and run driver_theta0.m.
	2. Simulation will run.
	3. After simulation runs, the plot will be displayed.
  	   A video file be be saved (or overwritten) as theta0.mp4

------------------------------------------------------------------------

For motion up to theta = 30 degrees:

	required:driver_theta30.m, set_figure.m, Invkin.m, draw*.m files

	1. Open and run driver_theta30.m.
	2. Simulation will run.
	3. After simulation runs, the plot will be displayed.
   	   A video file be be saved (or overwritten) as theta30.mp4

------------------------------------------------------------------------

For motion up to theta = 60 degrees:

	required: driver_theta60.m, set_figure.m, Invkin.m, draw*.m files

	1. Open and run driver_theta60.m.
	2. Simulation will run.
	3. After simulation runs, the plot will be displayed.
  	   A video file be be saved (or overwritten) as theta60.mp4
