To run the Pure Inverse Kinematics (PIK) Algorithm:

1. Open and run "PIK_Main.m"

=============================================

To run the Resolved Rates Algorithm (RRA):

1. Open and run "RRA_Main.m"

=============================================

Note: 

The algorithm automatically records and output the animation 
and plot files. Also, the following files need to be in the same 
folder as each of the scripts mentioned above:

1. DirKin.m
2. DrawRobot.m
3. InvKin.m (If running PIK)
4. RRA.m (If running RRA)
